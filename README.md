# TDD-JSON-Workbench

This project, TDD-JSON-Workbench, is designed to manage API data in a unique JSON format which contains information about API operations including request and response details. The tool provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for manipulating this JSON data. The application is built with React, a leading JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You can access the live application [here](https://prashant0690.github.io/tdd-json-workbench/).

## Features

* Generate API data in a structured JSON format including API operations and their request-response details.
* Providing CRUD operations for the JSON data.
* Allows users to download the data as a JSON file.


## Potential Use Cases

This project generates a structured JSON format for API operations including the request-response details, and thus can be used in a variety of scenarios:

1. **Understanding API Behavior:** The generated JSON serves as a blueprint of your API interactions and can be used to understand and document the behavior of the APIs being used in your application. This can be especially helpful for new developers who are trying to understand the system.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** This tool can be used to define and manage your API responses for various cases while developing your code, making the implementation of TDD more efficient.

3. **Mocking API Responses:** The tool is perfect for simulating API responses, allowing you to test how your code responds to various external API responses without making actual API requests.

4. **Automated API Testing:** This tool can be integrated into an automated test suite to define expected API responses, allowing you to automatically compare the actual response of your code with the expected one.

This structured JSON format can be easily extended and adapted for different applications and needs, which makes the TDD-JSON-Workbench a versatile tool for any developer.

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the application:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

The following JSON snippet enclosed within a code block is an example of the kind of API data that this tool can generate:

```json
[
  {
    "apiName": "jsonplaceholder",
    "endPointName": "methods",
    "testName": "Getting a resource",
    "request": {
      "path": "/posts/1",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
      },
      "queryParams": {},
      "pathParams": {},
      "body": "{}"
    },
    "response": {
      "status": 200,
      "headers": {},
      "body": "{\"userId\":1,\"id\":1,\"title\":\"sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit\",\"body\":\"quia et suscipit\\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto\"}"
    }
  },
  // more JSON objects...
]
```

## Contributions
